Terrain data for [MScSim](https://github.com/marek-cel/mscsim).

## Data Sources

Terrain data is based on publically available public domain data.

### Blue Marble Next Generation (BMNG)

The original Blue Marble is a photo taken by Apollo 17 astronauts on their way to the Moon on December 7th, 1972. In 2005 NASA released a series of satellite imagery of the entire Earth called Blue Marble Next Generation (BMNG).

### Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)

Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was conducted in February 2000 during STS-99 on board of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Its purpose was to obtain high resolution digital elevation models of most of the Earth surface.

### Landsat Satellite Imagery

Landsat is a joint USGS ans NASA program to obtain satellite imagery of Earth. Data from Landsat 7 satellite Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor can be used to obtain Earth true-color imagery. Data covers most of Earth land area.

### High Resolution Orthoimagery

USGS High Resolution Orthoimagery (HRO) is a collections of aerial photographs with resolution 1 m/pixel or finer, managed and distributed by the USGS EROS Center. Since data came from multiple vendors, resolution, area of coverage, projection, etc. varies.

### MODIS MOD44W Watermask

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an imaging sensor on board of the Terra satellite. It was launched by NASA in 1999. MODIS Land Water Mask (MOD44W) is a global raster water mask at 250 m/pixel resolution.
